**Comprehensive Test Plan: Security Auditing and Vulnerability Assessment**

**Project Overview:**
- Project Name: [Insert Project Name]
- Description: [Insert Project Description]
- Scope: Conduct security auditing and vulnerability assessment for the project, including MongoDB database, Express.js API, and Next.js frontend.

**Test Objectives:**

1. Identify security vulnerabilities in the project.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures.
3. Provide recommendations for improvement and remediation.

**Test Scope:**

1. MongoDB Database:
	* Authentication and Authorization
	* Data Encryption
	* Access Control
	* Backup and Recovery
2. Express.js API:
	* Authentication and Authorization
	* Input Validation
	* Error Handling
	* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
3. Next.js Frontend:
	* Authentication and Authorization
	* Input Validation
	* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection
	* Secure File Uploads

**Test Scenarios:**

1. Authentication and Authorization:
	* Test scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
		+ Expected outcome: User is redirected to the dashboard
		+ Edge case: Test with invalid credentials, CAPTCHA, and rate limiting
	* Test scenario: Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
		+ Expected outcome: User is redirected to the login page
		+ Edge case: Test with rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and lockout policy
2. Input Validation:
	* Test scenario: Valid input data
		+ Expected outcome: Data is processed successfully
		+ Edge case: Test with malicious input data (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
	* Test scenario: Invalid input data
		+ Expected outcome: Error message is displayed
		+ Edge case: Test with rate limiting and error handling
3. Error Handling:
	* Test scenario: Server-side error
		+ Expected outcome: Error message is displayed
		+ Edge case: Test with rate limiting and error handling
	* Test scenario: Client-side error
		+ Expected outcome: Error message is displayed
		+ Edge case: Test with rate limiting and error handling
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection:
	* Test scenario: Valid request
		+ Expected outcome: Request is processed successfully
		+ Edge case: Test with malicious request (e.g., XSS, CSRF)
	* Test scenario: Invalid request
		+ Expected outcome: Error message is displayed
		+ Edge case: Test with rate limiting and error handling
5. Secure File Uploads:
	* Test scenario: Valid file upload
		+ Expected outcome: File is uploaded successfully
		+ Edge case: Test with malicious file (e.g., virus, malware)
	* Test scenario: Invalid file upload
		+ Expected outcome: Error message is displayed
		+ Edge case: Test with rate limiting and error handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
