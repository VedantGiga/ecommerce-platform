**Comprehensive Test Plan for User Authentication API Endpoints**

**Test Objectives:**

1. Verify the user authentication API endpoints are functioning as expected.
2. Identify and report any bugs or issues found during testing.
3. Ensure the API endpoints meet the required quality standards.

**Test Scope:**

* The user authentication API endpoints will be tested using Postman or a similar tool.
* The test cases will cover the following API endpoints:
	+ User registration
	+ User login
	+ User logout
	+ Password reset
* The test cases will be executed on a production-like environment.

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Valid User Registration**
	* Preconditions: None
	* Steps:
		1. Send a POST request to the user registration API endpoint with valid user credentials (e.g., email, password, name).
		2. Verify the response status code is 201 (Created).
		3. Verify the user is created successfully in the database.
	* Expected Outcome: The user is created successfully in the database.
2. **Invalid User Registration**
	* Preconditions: None
	* Steps:
		1. Send a POST request to the user registration API endpoint with invalid user credentials (e.g., email, password, name).
		2. Verify the response status code is 400 (Bad Request).
		3. Verify the error message is displayed correctly.
	* Expected Outcome: The error message is displayed correctly.
3. **Valid User Login**
	* Preconditions: User is registered successfully.
	* Steps:
		1. Send a POST request to the user login API endpoint with valid user credentials (e.g., email, password).
		2. Verify the response status code is 200 (OK).
		3. Verify the user is logged in successfully.
	* Expected Outcome: The user is logged in successfully.
4. **Invalid User Login**
	* Preconditions: User is registered successfully.
	* Steps:
		1. Send a POST request to the user login API endpoint with invalid user credentials (e.g., email, password).
		2. Verify the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized).
		3. Verify the error message is displayed correctly.
	* Expected Outcome: The error message is displayed correctly.
5. **User Logout**
	* Preconditions: User is logged in successfully.
	* Steps:
		1. Send a POST request to the user logout API endpoint.
		2. Verify the response status code is 200 (OK).
		3. Verify the user is logged out successfully.
	* Expected Outcome: The user is logged out successfully.
6. **Password Reset**
	* Preconditions: User is registered successfully.
	* Steps:
		1. Send a POST request to the password reset API endpoint with valid user credentials (e.g., email).
		2. Verify the response status code is 200 (OK).
		3. Verify the password is reset successfully.
	* Expected Outcome: The password is reset successfully.

**Edge Cases to Test:**

1. **Empty Email**
	* Send a POST request to the user registration API endpoint with an empty email.
	* Verify the response status code is 400 (Bad Request).
	* Verify the error message is displayed correctly.
2. **Invalid Email Format**
	* Send a POST request to the user registration API endpoint with an invalid email format (e.g., missing @ symbol).
	* Verify the response status code is 400 (Bad Request).
	* Verify the error message is displayed correctly.
3. **Weak Password**
	* Send a POST request to the user registration API endpoint with a weak password (e.g., less than 8 characters).
	* Verify the response status code is 400 (Bad Request).
	* Verify the error message is displayed correctly.
4. **Password Reset with Invalid Email**
	* Send a POST request to the password reset API endpoint with an invalid email.
	* Verify the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized).
	* Verify the error message is displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The user authentication API endpoints are functioning as expected.
2. The API endpoints meet the required quality standards.
3. All test cases are executed successfully without any errors.
4. The error messages are displayed correctly in case of invalid user credentials.

**Quality Metrics:**

1. **Test Coverage:** 100% of the user authentication API endpoints are tested.
2. **Test Efficiency:** The test cases are executed efficiently with minimal rework.
3. **Test Effectiveness:** The test cases are effective in identifying bugs and issues.
4. **Defect Density:** The defect density is low, indicating a high-quality product.

**Test Schedule:**

The testing will be conducted over a period of 5 days, with the following schedule:

Day 1: Test planning and preparation
Day 2: Test execution (user registration and login)
Day 3: Test execution (password reset and logout)
Day 4: Test execution (edge cases and error handling)
Day 5: Test closure and reporting

**Test Resources:**

* Postman or similar tool for API testing
* A production-like environment for testing
* A test plan document
* A test case document
* A test execution log
* A defect tracking system
